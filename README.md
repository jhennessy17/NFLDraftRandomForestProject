# NFLDraftRandomForestProject

This project uses a random forest algorithm and data maniupaltion to create machine learning models that will guess the round in which NFL prospects will be drafted.  Each machine learning model maintains an accuracy rating of around 80% correction in guessing the round in which a player will be drafted based on combine statistics.
